        Return the maximum of the matrix or maximum along an axis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : {-2, -1, 0, 1, None} optional
            Axis along which the sum is computed. The default is to
            compute the maximum over all the matrix elements, returning

        Returns
        -------
        amax : coo_matrix or scalar
            Maximum of `a`. If `axis` is None, the result is a scalar value.
            If `axis` is given, the result is a sparse.coo_matrix of dimension
