    Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array_like
        A 1-d endogenous response variable. The dependent variable.
    lags : {int, list[int]}
        The number of lags to include in the model if an integer or the
        list of lag indices to include.  For example, [1, 4] will only
        include lags 1 and 4 while lags=4 will include lags 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    exog : array_like
        Exogenous variables to include in the model. Either a DataFrame or
        an 2-d array-like structure that can be converted to a NumPy array.
    order : {int, sequence[int], dict}
        If int, uses lags 0, 1, ..., order  for all exog variables. If
        sequence[int], uses the ``order`` for all variables. If a dict,
        applies the lags series by series. If ``exog`` is anything other
        than a DataFrame, the keys are the column index of exog (e.g., 0,
        1, ...). If a DataFrame, keys are column names.
    fixed : array_like
        Additional fixed regressors that are not lagged.
    causal : bool, optional
        Whether to include lag 0 of exog variables.  If True, only includes
        lags 1, 2, ...
    trend : {'n', 'c', 't', 'ct'}, optional
        The trend to include in the model:

        * 'n' - No trend.
        * 'c' - Constant only.
        * 't' - Time trend only.
        * 'ct' - Constant and time trend.

        The default is 'c'.

    seasonal : bool, optional
        Flag indicating whether to include seasonal dummies in the model. If
        seasonal is True and trend includes 'c', then the first period
        is excluded from the seasonal terms.
    deterministic : DeterministicProcess, optional
        A deterministic process.  If provided, trend and seasonal are ignored.
        A warning is raised if trend is not "n" and seasonal is not False.
    hold_back : {None, int}, optional
        Initial observations to exclude from the estimation sample.  If None,
        then hold_back is equal to the maximum lag in the model.  Set to a
        non-zero value to produce comparable models with different lag
        length.  For example, to compare the fit of a model with lags=3 and
        lags=1, set hold_back=3 which ensures that both models are estimated
        using observations 3,...,nobs. hold_back must be >= the maximum lag in
        the model.
    period : {None, int}, optional
        The period of the data. Only used if seasonal is True. This parameter
        can be omitted if using a pandas object for endog that contains a
        recognized frequency.
    missing : {"none", "drop", "raise"}, optional
        Available options are 'none', 'drop', and 'raise'. If 'none', no nan
        checking is done. If 'drop', any observations with nans are dropped.
        If 'raise', an error is raised. Default is 'none'.

    Notes
    -----
    The full specification of an ARDL is

    .. math ::

       Y_t = \delta_0 + \delta_1 t + \delta_2 t^2
             + \sum_{i=1}^{s-1} \gamma_i I_{[(\mod(t,s) + 1) = i]}
             + \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_j Y_{t-j}
             + \sum_{l=1}^k \sum_{m=0}^{o_l} \beta_{l,m} X_{l, t-m}
             + Z_t \lambda
             + \epsilon_t

    where :math:`\delta_\bullet` capture trends, :math:`\gamma_\bullet`
    capture seasonal shifts, s is the period of the seasonality, p is the
    lag length of the endogenous variable, k is the number of exogenous
    variables :math:`X_{l}`, :math:`o_l` is included the lag length of
    :math:`X_{l}`, :math:`Z_t` are ``r`` included fixed regressors and
    :math:`\epsilon_t` is a white noise shock. If ``causal`` is ``True``,
    then the 0-th lag of the exogenous variables is not included and the
    sum starts at ``m=1``.

    >>> data = danish_data.load_pandas().data
    >>> lrm = data.lrm

    A basic model where all variables have 3 lags included

    >>> ARDL(data.lrm, 3, data[["lry", "ibo", "ide"]], 3)

    A dictionary can be used to pass custom lag orders

    >>> ARDL(data.lrm, [1, 3], exog, {"lry": 1, "ibo": 3, "ide": 2})

    Setting causal removes the 0-th lag from the exogenous variables

    >>> exog_lags = {"lry": 1, "ibo": 3, "ide": 2}
    >>> ARDL(data.lrm, [1, 3], exog, exog_lags, causal=True)

    A dictionary can also be used to pass specific lags to include.
    Sequences hold the specific lags to include, while integers are expanded
    to include [0, 1, ..., lag]. If causal is False, then the 0-th lag is
    excluded.

    >>> ARDL(lrm, [1, 3], exog, {"lry": [0, 1], "ibo": [0, 1, 3], "ide": 2})

    When using NumPy arrays, the dictionary keys are the column index.

        Estimate the model parameters.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cov_type : str
            The covariance estimator to use. The most common choices are listed
            below.  Supports all covariance estimators that are available
            in ``OLS.fit``.

            * 'nonrobust' - The class OLS covariance estimator that assumes
              homoskedasticity.
            * 'HC0', 'HC1', 'HC2', 'HC3' - Variants of White's
              (or Eiker-Huber-White) covariance estimator. `HC0` is the
              standard implementation.  The other make corrections to improve
              the finite sample performance of the heteroskedasticity robust
              covariance estimator.
            * 'HAC' - Heteroskedasticity-autocorrelation robust covariance
              estimation. Supports cov_kwds.

              - `maxlags` integer (required) : number of lags to use.
              - `kernel` callable or str (optional) : kernel
                  currently available kernels are ['bartlett', 'uniform'],
                  default is Bartlett.
              - `use_correction` bool (optional) : If true, use small sample
                  correction.
        cov_kwds : dict, optional
            A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the covariance
            estimator. `nonrobust` and `HC#` do not support cov_kwds.
        use_t : bool, optional
            A flag indicating that inference should use the Student's t
            distribution that accounts for model degree of freedom.  If False,
            uses the normal distribution. If None, defers the choice to
            the cov_type. It also removes degree of freedom corrections from
            the covariance estimator when cov_type is 'nonrobust'.

        params : array_like
            The fitted model parameters.
        start : int, str, or datetime, optional
            Zero-indexed observation number at which to start forecasting,
            i.e., the first forecast is start. Can also be a date string to
            parse or a datetime type. Default is the the zeroth observation.

            Zero-indexed observation number at which to end forecasting, i.e.,
            the last forecast is end. Can also be a date string to
            parse or a datetime type. However, if the dates index does not

            that all the predictions [start, start+1, ..., end-1, end] are

        dynamic : {bool, int, str, datetime, Timestamp}, optional
            Integer offset relative to `start` at which to begin dynamic
            prediction. Prior to this observation, true endogenous values
            will be used for prediction; starting with this observation and
            continuing through the end of prediction, forecasted endogenous
            values will be used instead. Datetime-like objects are not
            interpreted as offsets. They are instead used to find the index
            location of `dynamic` which is then used to to compute the offset.
        exog : array_like
            A replacement exogenous array.  Must have the same shape as the
            exogenous data array used when the model was created.
        exog_oos : array_like
            An array containing out-of-sample values of the exogenous
            variables. Must have the same number of columns as the exog
            used when the model was created, and at least as many rows as
            the number of out-of-sample forecasts.
        fixed : array_like
            A replacement fixed array.  Must have the same shape as the
            fixed data array used when the model was created.
        fixed_oos : array_like
            An array containing out-of-sample values of the fixed variables.

        order : {int, sequence[int], dict}
            If int, uses lags 0, 1, ..., order  for all exog variables. If
            sequence[int], uses the ``order`` for all variables. If a dict,

        seasonal : bool, optional
            Flag indicating whether to include seasonal dummies in the model.
            If seasonal is True and trend includes 'c', then the first period

        deterministic : DeterministicProcess, optional
            A deterministic process.  If provided, trend and seasonal are

            Initial observations to exclude from the estimation sample.  If
            None, then hold_back is equal to the maximum lag in the model.
            Set to a non-zero value to produce comparable models with

            parameter can be omitted if using a pandas object for endog
            that contains a recognized frequency.
        missing : {"none", "drop", "raise"}, optional

            parse or a datetime type. Default is the the zeroth observation.
        end : int, str, or datetime, optional
            Zero-indexed observation number at which to end forecasting, i.e.,
            the last forecast is end. Can also be a date string to
            parse or a datetime type. However, if the dates index does not
            have a fixed frequency, end must be an integer index if you

            will be used for prediction; starting with this observation and
            continuing through the end of prediction, forecasted endogenous
            values will be used instead. Datetime-like objects are not
            interpreted as offsets. They are instead used to find the index
            location of `dynamic` which is then used to to compute the offset.
        exog : array_like
            A replacement exogenous array.  Must have the same shape as the
            exogenous data array used when the model was created.

            An array containing out-of-sample values of the exogenous variable.
            Must has the same number of columns as the exog used when the

            out-of-sample forecasts.
        fixed : array_like
            A replacement fixed array.  Must have the same shape as the

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array_like
        A 1-d endogenous response variable. The dependent variable.
    maxlag : int
        The maximum lag to consider for the endogenous variable.
    exog : array_like
        Exogenous variables to include in the model. Either a DataFrame or
        an 2-d array-like structure that can be converted to a NumPy array.
    maxorder : {int, dict}
        If int, sets a common max lag length for all exog variables. If
        a dict, then sets individual lag length. They keys are column names
        if exog is a DataFrame or column indices otherwise.
    trend : {'n', 'c', 't', 'ct'}, optional
        The trend to include in the model:

        * 'n' - No trend.
        * 'c' - Constant only.
        * 't' - Time trend only.
        * 'ct' - Constant and time trend.

        The default is 'c'.
    fixed : array_like
        Additional fixed regressors that are not lagged.
    causal : bool, optional
        Whether to include lag 0 of exog variables.  If True, only includes
        lags 1, 2, ...
    ic : {"aic", "bic", "hqic"}
        The information criterion to use in model selection.
    glob : bool
        Whether to consider all possible submodels of the largest model
        or only if smaller order lags must be included if larger order
        lags are.  If ``True``, the number of model considered is of the
        order 2**(maxlag + k * maxorder) assuming maxorder is an int. This
        can be very large unless k and maxorder are bot relatively small.
        If False, the number of model considered is of the order
        maxlag*maxorder**k which may also be substantial when k and maxorder
        are large.
    seasonal : bool, optional
        Flag indicating whether to include seasonal dummies in the model. If
        seasonal is True and trend includes 'c', then the first period
        is excluded from the seasonal terms.
    deterministic : DeterministicProcess, optional
        A deterministic process.  If provided, trend and seasonal are ignored.
        A warning is raised if trend is not "n" and seasonal is not False.
    hold_back : {None, int}, optional
        Initial observations to exclude from the estimation sample.  If None,
        then hold_back is equal to the maximum lag in the model.  Set to a
        non-zero value to produce comparable models with different lag

        the model.
    period : {None, int}, optional
        The period of the data. Only used if seasonal is True. This parameter

    capture seasonal shifts, s is the period of the seasonality, p is the
    lag length of the endogenous variable, k is the number of exogenous

        Cointegration bounds test of Pesaran, Shin, and Smith

        Parameters
        ----------
        case : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
            One of the cases covered in the PSS test.
        cov_type : str
            The covariance estimator to use. The asymptotic distribution of
            the PSS test has only been established in the homoskedastic case,
            which is the default.

            The most common choices are listed below.  Supports all covariance
            estimators that are available in ``OLS.fit``.

            * 'nonrobust' - The class OLS covariance estimator that assumes
              homoskedasticity.
            * 'HC0', 'HC1', 'HC2', 'HC3' - Variants of White's
              (or Eiker-Huber-White) covariance estimator. `HC0` is the
              standard implementation.  The other make corrections to improve
              the finite sample performance of the heteroskedasticity robust
              covariance estimator.
            * 'HAC' - Heteroskedasticity-autocorrelation robust covariance
              estimation. Supports cov_kwds.

              - `maxlags` integer (required) : number of lags to use.
              - `kernel` callable or str (optional) : kernel
                  currently available kernels are ['bartlett', 'uniform'],
                  default is Bartlett.
              - `use_correction` bool (optional) : If true, use small sample
                  correction.
        cov_kwds : dict, optional
            A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the covariance
            estimator. `nonrobust` and `HC#` do not support cov_kwds.
        use_t : bool, optional
            A flag indicating that small-sample corrections should be applied
            to the covariance estimator.
        asymptotic : bool
            Flag indicating whether to use asymptotic critical values which
            were computed by simulation (True, default) or to simulate a
            sample-size specific set of critical values. Tables are only
            available for up to 10 components in the cointegrating
            relationship, so if more variables are included then simulation
            is always used. The simulation computed the test statistic under
            and assumption that the residuals are homoskedastic.
        nsim : int
            Number of simulations to run when computing exact critical values.
            Only used if ``asymptotic`` is ``True``.
        seed : {None, int, sequence[int], RandomState, Generator}, optional
            Seed to use when simulating critical values. Must be provided if
            reproducible critical value and p-values are required when
            ``asymptotic`` is ``False``.

        Returns
        -------
        BoundsTestResult
            Named tuple containing ``stat``, ``crit_vals``, ``p_values``,
            ``null` and ``alternative``. The statistic is the F-type
            test statistic favored in PSS.

        Notes
        -----
        The PSS bounds test has 5 cases which test the coefficients on the
        level terms in the model

        .. math::

           \Delta Y_{t}=\delta_{0} + \delta_{1}t + Z_{t-1}\beta
                        + \sum_{j=0}^{P}\Delta X_{t-j}\Gamma + \epsilon_{t}

        where :math:`Z_{t-1}` contains both :math:`Y_{t-1}` and
        :math:`X_{t-1}`.

        The cases determine which deterministic terms are included in the
        model and which are tested as part of the test.

        Cases:

        1. No deterministic terms
        2. Constant included in both the model and the test
        3. Constant included in the model but not in the test
        4. Constant and trend included in the model, only trend included in
           the test
        5. Constant and trend included in the model, neither included in the
           test

        The test statistic is a Wald-type quadratic form test that all of the
        coefficients in :math:`\beta` are 0 along with any included
        deterministic terms, which depends on the case. The statistic returned
        is an F-type test statistic which is the standard quadratic form test
        statistic divided by the number of restrictions.
