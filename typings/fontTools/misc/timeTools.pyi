def asctime(t=...): # -> str:
	"""
	Convert a tuple or struct_time representing a time as returned by gmtime()
	or localtime() to a 24-character string of the following form:

	>>> asctime(time.gmtime(0))
	'Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970'

	If t is not provided, the current time as returned by localtime() is used.
	Locale information is not used by asctime().

	This is meant to normalise the output of the built-in time.asctime() across
	different platforms and Python versions.
	In Python 3.x, the day of the month is right-justified, whereas on Windows
	Python 2.7 it is padded with zeros.

	See https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/455
